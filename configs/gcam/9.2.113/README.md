**Use stock cam for selfies, gcam ports as of now have a worse front cam performance on this device.    
Video stabilisation is similar, except for the ultra steady 1080p60 mode, which is only available on stock camera.     
Rear cameras' photos came out better on gcam, except that skin tones are darkened sometimes, the issue isn't there on stock camera**
